    "### P1: Image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic deep learning project that is a great way to learn the basics of how to train and evaluate a neural network. You can use a pre-existing dataset like CIFAR-10 or MNIST, or you can collect your own dataset of images. Your goal is to train a model that can correctly classify images into different categories, whether the labels are for animals, vehicles, or handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### P2: Object detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a step up from image classification, as it requires your model to be able to localize objects within an image. You can use a pre-existing dataset like COCO or Pascal VOC, or you can collect your own dataset of images with labeled objects. Your goal is to train a model that can detect all of the objects in an image and draw bounding boxes around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### P3: Semantic segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is even more challenging than object detection, as it requires your model to be able to segment each object in an image into its individual parts. For example, if an image contains a car, your model would need to be able to segment the car into its body, wheels, windows, and other parts. You can use a pre-existing dataset like Cityscapes or CamVid, or you can collect your own dataset of images with labeled pixels. Your goal is to train a model that can accurately segment all of the objects in an image."

    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many places where you can find open datasets for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Here are a few suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Google AI Datasets**: Google AI maintains a public repository of datasets for a variety of machine learning tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.\n",
    "- **Kaggle**: Kaggle is a popular platform for data science competitions and collaboration. It also hosts a number of open datasets, including many for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.\n",
    "- **Papers with Code**: Papers with Code is a website that indexes machine learning papers and datasets. You can search for datasets by task, keyword, or paper title."

    "**3. Model compilation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specify the loss function. This is the function that Keras will use to measure how well your model is performing during training.\n",
    "* Choose an optimizer. This is the algorithm that Keras will use to update the weights of your model during training.\n",
    "* Select metrics to track. These are the metrics that Keras will use to evaluate the performance of your model during training and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Model training**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train the model. You can use Keras' `fit()` function to train your model on the training data.\n",
    "* Monitor the training process. You can use Keras' `Callback` class to monitor the training process and make adjustments as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Model evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluate the model on the test data. You can use Keras' `evaluate()` function to evaluate the performance of your model on the test data.\n",
    "* Make predictions on new data. You can use Keras' `predict()` function to make predictions on new data."
